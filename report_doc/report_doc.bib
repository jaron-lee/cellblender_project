	abstract = {Dendritic spines are critical elements of cortical circuits, since they establish most excitatory synapses. Recent studies have reported correlations between morphological and functional parameters of spines. Specifically, the spine head volume is correlated with the area of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the number of postsynaptic receptors and the ready-releasable pool of transmitter, whereas the length of the spine neck is proportional to the degree of biochemical and electrical isolation of the spine from its parent dendrite. Therefore, the morphology of a spine could determine its synaptic strength and learning rules.To better understand the natural variability of neocortical spine morphologies, we used a combination of gold-toned Golgi impregnations and serial thin-section electron microscopy and performed three-dimensional reconstructions of spines from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells from mouse visual cortex. We characterized the structure and synaptic features of 144 completed reconstructed spines, and analyzed their morphologies according to their positions. For all morphological parameters analyzed, spines exhibited a continuum of variability, without clearly distinguishable subtypes of spines or clear dependence of their morphologies on their distance to the soma. On average, the spine head volume was correlated strongly with PSD area and weakly with neck diameter, but not with neck length. The large morphological diversity suggests an equally large variability of synaptic strength and learning rules}

	abstract = {Neurotransmitter release is mediated by Ca2+ dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Neither the amount of transmitter released from individual synaptic vesicles nor the kinetics of this process have yet been directly determined. Using carbon fibres as electrochemical detectors, we have measured release of the neurotransmitter serotonin from cultured neurons of the leech. This technique allowed us to monitor transmitter discharge from single synaptic vesicles as spike-like oxidation currents at high time resolution, providing new insight into the mechanism of neuronal exocytosis. Two types of signals were characterized, corresponding to exocytosis of small clear and large dense core vesicles present in these cells. A small vesicle discharges about 4,700 transmitter molecules with a time constant in the region of 260 microseconds, whereas large vesicles release their content of approximately 80,000 molecules with a time constant of about 1.3 ms. Release from both vesicle types is initiated rapidly, with a rise time of less than 60 microseconds, suggesting an abrupt opening of a preassembled fusion pore}

	abstract = {Spatially realistic diffusion-reaction simulations supplement traditional experiments and provide testable hypotheses for complex physiological systems. To date, however, the creation of realistic 3D cell models has been difficult and time-consuming, typically involving hand reconstruction from electron microscopic images. Here, we present a complementary approach that is much simpler and faster, because the cell architecture (geometry) is created directly in silico using 3D modeling software like that used for commercial film animations. We show how a freely available open source program (Blender) can be used to create the model geometry, which then can be read by our Monte Carlo simulation and visualization softwares (MCell and DReAMM, respectively). This new workflow allows rapid prototyping and development of realistic computational models, and thus should dramatically accelerate their use by a wide variety of computational and experimental investigators. Using two self-contained examples based on synaptic transmission, we illustrate the creation of 3D cellular geometry with Blender, addition of molecules, reactions, and other run-time conditions using MCell's Model Description Language (MDL), and subsequent MCell simulations and DReAMM visualizations. In the first example, we simulate calcium influx through voltage-gated channels localized on a presynaptic bouton, with subsequent intracellular calcium diffusion and binding to sites on synaptic vesicles. In the second example, we simulate neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles as they fuse with the presynaptic membrane, subsequent transmitter diffusion into the synaptic cleft, and binding to postsynaptic receptors on a dendritic spine}

Fortunately, using computational approaches, we can obtain important new insights into the inner workings of these important neural systems. Here, we report the development of a spatially realistic computational model of an entire frog active zone in which we constrained model parameters with experimental data, and then used Monte Carlo simulation methods to predict the Ca(2+)-binding stoichiometry and dynamics that underlie neurotransmitter release. Our model reveals that 20-40 independent Ca(2+)-binding sites on synaptic vesicles, only a fraction of which need to bind Ca(2+) to trigger fusion, are sufficient to predict physiological release. Our excess-Ca(2+)-binding-site model has many functional advantages, agrees with recent data on synaptotagmin copy number, and is the first (to our knowledge) to link detailed physiological observations with the molecular machinery of Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis. In addition, our model provides detailed microscopic insight into the underlying Ca(2+) dynamics during synapse activation}

	abstract = {Short-term synaptic facilitation occurs during high-frequency stimulation, is known to be dependent on presynaptic calcium ions, and persists for tens of milliseconds after a presynaptic action potential. We have used the frog neuromuscular junction as a model synapse for both experimental and computer simulation studies aimed at testing various mechanistic hypotheses proposed to underlie short-term synaptic facilitation. Building off our recently reported excess-calcium-binding-site model of synaptic vesicle release at the frog neuromuscular junction (Dittrich M, Pattillo JM, King JD, Cho S, Stiles JR, Meriney SD. Biophys J 104: 2751-2763, 2013), we have investigated several mechanisms of short-term facilitation at the frog neuromuscular junction. Our studies place constraints on previously proposed facilitation mechanisms and conclude that the presence of a second class of calcium sensor proteins distinct from synaptotagmin can explain known properties of facilitation observed at the frog neuromuscular junction. We were further able to identify a novel facilitation mechanism, which relied on the persistent binding of calcium-bound synaptotagmin molecules to lipids of the presynaptic membrane. In a real physiological context, both mechanisms identified in our study (and perhaps others) may act simultaneously to cause the experimentally observed facilitation. In summary, using a combination of computer simulations and physiological recordings, we have developed a stochastic computer model of synaptic transmission at the frog neuromuscular junction, which sheds light on the facilitation mechanisms in this model synapse}

	abstract = {The sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) is a widespread transporter that exchanges sodium and calcium ions across excitable membranes. Normally, NCX mainly operates in its "forward" mode, harnessing the electrochemical gradient of sodium ions to expel calcium. During membrane depolarization or elevated internal sodium levels, NCX can instead switch the direction of net flux to expel sodium and allow calcium entry. Such "reverse"-mode NCX operation is frequently implicated during pathological or artificially extended periods of depolarization, not during normal activity. We have used fast calcium imaging, mathematical simulation, and whole cell electrophysiology to study the role of NCX at the parallel fiber-to-Purkinje neuron synapse in the mouse cerebellum. We show that nontraditional, reverse-mode NCX activity boosts the amplitude and duration of parallel fiber calcium transients during short bursts of high-frequency action potentials typical of their behavior in vivo. Simulations, supported by experimental manipulations, showed that accumulation of intracellular sodium drove NCX into reverse mode. This mechanism fueled additional calcium influx into the parallel fibers that promoted synaptic transmission to Purkinje neurons for up to 400 ms after the burst. Thus we provide the first functional demonstration of transient and fast NCX-mediated calcium entry at a major central synapse. This unexpected contribution from reverse-mode NCX appears critical for shaping presynaptic calcium dynamics and transiently boosting synaptic transmission, and is likely to optimize the accuracy of cerebellar information transfer}

	abstract = {The brain relies on GABAergic neurons to control the ongoing activity of neuronal networks. GABAergic neurons control the firing pattern of excitatory cells, the temporal structure of membrane potential oscillations and the time window for integration of synaptic inputs. These actions require a fine control of the timing of GABA receptor activation which, in turn, depends on the precise timing of GABA release from pre-synaptic terminals and GABA clearance from the extracellular space. Extracellular GABA is not subject to enzymatic breakdown, and its clearance relies entirely on diffusion and uptake by specific transporters. In contrast to glutamate transporters, GABA transporters are abundantly expressed in neuronal pre-synaptic terminals. GABA transporters move laterally within the plasma membrane and are continuously trafficked to/from intracellular compartments. It is hypothesized that due to their proximity to GABA release sites, changes in the concentration and lateral mobility of GABA transporters may have a significant effect on the time course of the GABA concentration profile in and out of the synaptic cleft. To date, this hypothesis remains to be tested. Here we use 3D Monte Carlo reaction-diffusion simulations to analyze how changes in the density of expression and lateral mobility of GABA transporters in the cell membrane affect the extracellular GABA concentration profile and the activation of GABA receptors. Our results indicate that these manipulations mainly alter the GABA concentration profile away from the synaptic cleft. These findings provide novel insights into how the ability of GABA transporters to undergo plastic changes may alter the strength of GABAergic signals and the activity of neuronal networks in the brain}

	abstract = {1. EPSCs were evoked in CA1 pyramidal neurones of young rats in vitro by extracellular stimulation of axons in a restricted stratum radiatum field, and were recorded using the whole-cell technique. 2. Quantal fluctuations in EPSC amplitude could be demonstrated for nineteen of fifty EPSCs analysed. Quantal currents (at the soma) ranged from 2.6 to 9.5 pA (after correction for the access resistance) with a mean of 4.0 +/- 2.0 pA. 3. Quantal variance was negligible for the majority (13/19) of the EPSCs. However, a large quantal variance (with a coefficient of variation > 0.4) is one possible reason why a large number of the EPSCs (29/50) could not be shown to have quantal fluctuations. 4. The statistical pattern of fluctuations in the amplitude of the majority of the quantal EPSCs (18/19) could not be described by conventional models of transmitter release. 5. The time course of the EPSC and a compartmental model of CA1 pyramidal neurones were used to calculate synaptic location. The quantal current (at the soma) was independent of the electrotonic location of the synapse at which it was evoked. The peak quantal conductance generating each quantal current ranged from 0.5 to 6.8 nS (mean 1.3 +/- 1.4 nS), its magnitude increasing with distance from the soma. The mean peak conductance is likely to be generated by the opening of at least 60-160 AMPA channels}

	abstract = {In eukaryotes, most intracellular membrane fusion reactions are mediated by the interaction of SNARE proteins that are present in both fusing membranes. However, the minimal number of SNARE complexes needed for membrane fusion is not known. Here we show unambiguously that one SNARE complex is sufficient for membrane fusion. We performed controlled in vitro F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and found that liposomes bearing only a single SNARE molecule are still capable of fusion with other liposomes or with purified synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that multiple SNARE complexes do not act cooperatively, showing that synergy between several SNARE complexes is not needed for membrane fusion. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and call for a revision of current views of fusion events such as the fast release of neurotransmitters}

	abstract = {Synaptic vesicle recycling has long served as a model for the general mechanisms of cellular trafficking. We used an integrative approach, combining quantitative immunoblotting and mass spectrometry to determine protein numbers; electron microscopy to measure organelle numbers, sizes, and positions; and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to localize the proteins. Using these data, we generated a three-dimensional model of an "average" synapse, displaying 300,000 proteins in atomic detail. The copy numbers of proteins involved in the same step of synaptic vesicle recycling correlated closely. In contrast, copy numbers varied over more than three orders of magnitude between steps, from about 150 copies for the endosomal fusion proteins to more than 20,000 for the exocytotic ones}
