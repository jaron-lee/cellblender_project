# Simulating calcium buffering and handling at nerve terminals with CellBlender/MCell
Files, scripts and documentation from a research project conducted under the supervision of A/Prof Christian Stricker to investigate the use of CellBlender/MCell in simulating calcium handling and buffering at nerve terminals.
These items were submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements of an Advanced Studies Project undertaken as part of my degree.

##The Report
See the file report_doc.pdf for the scientific overview of the project, the modelling approach, results from an example project and the cited values for the model parameters.

##The Tutorial
See the file tutorial_doc.pdf for the technical instructions on how to set up the model in Blender, input the required settings and parameters, and produce a visualisation. Before attempting the tutorial, the user should be have at least a passing familiarity with Blender (at http://www.blender.org/), have completed the CellBlender tutorial (at http://www.mcell.org/tutorials/), and have a working Python and IPython Notebook installation (at http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

##The IPython Notebook
The tutorial document will direct the user to some scripts which have been stored in an IPython notebook.

##The Blender Files
bouton_v3 contains the presynaptic-side simulation files, while bouton_v4 contains the postsynaptic-side simulation files. 

bouton_v5 contains the combined simulation files (which are drawn from the folder viz_combined). This file is the one used for generating figures in the report.

##The Animation Files
Sample videos have been generated and placed here for a visualisation of the final result.
