Defining molecules with the following theoretical average diffusion distances:
  l_r_bar=0.00177245385 um for LGIC_C
  l_r_bar=0 um for LGIC_O
  l_r_bar=0.164294487 um for NT


Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 4.0428e-02 set for LGIC_C{1} + NT{1} -> LGIC_O{1} 



Surfaces with surface class "nt_reflect{1}" are REFLECTIVE for volume molecules  NT{1}.



Surfaces with surface class "nt_trans{1}" are TRANSPARENT for volume molecules  NT{1}.



Surfaces with surface class "nt_absorb{1}" are ABSORPTIVE for volume molecules  NT{1}.
