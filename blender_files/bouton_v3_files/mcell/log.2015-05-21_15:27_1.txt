Exiting run loop.
Warning: Some reactions were missed because reaction probability exceeded 1.
  Ca[1] + CaBS_Ca[1]  --  62.555% of reactions missed.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of Ca was 27.6 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of VGCC_C was 1.84 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.
