Defining molecules with the following theoretical average diffusion distances:
  l_r_bar=0.0713649646 um for Ca
  l_r_bar=0 um for VGCC_C
  l_r_bar=0 um for VGCC_O
  l_r_bar=0 um for CaBS
  l_r_bar=0 um for CaBS_Ca


Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 5.0000e-04 set for CaBS_Ca{1} -> Ca{1} CaBS{1}

Surfaces with surface class "ca_absorb{1}" are ABSORPTIVE for volume molecules  Ca{-1}.



Surfaces with surface class "ca_trans{1}" are TRANSPARENT for volume molecules  Ca{1}.
