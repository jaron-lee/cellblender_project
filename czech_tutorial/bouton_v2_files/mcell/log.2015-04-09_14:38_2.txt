Warning: Some reactions were missed because reaction probability exceeded 1.
  CaBS_Ca[1] + CaBS_Ca[1]  --  99.936% of reactions missed.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of Ca was 3.23 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of CaBS_Ca was 23.83 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of NT was 6.12 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of VGCC_C was 2.16 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.
