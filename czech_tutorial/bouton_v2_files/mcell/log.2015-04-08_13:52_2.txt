Defining molecules with the following theoretical average diffusion distances:
  l_r_bar=0.0713649646 um for Ca
  l_r_bar=0 um for VGCC_C
  l_r_bar=0 um for VGCC_O
  l_r_bar=0.177245385 um for CaBS
  l_r_bar=0 um for CaBS_Ca
  l_r_bar=0.225675833 um for NT


Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 5.0000e-04 set for CaBS_Ca{1} -> Ca{1} CaBS{1} 

Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 1.6667e+03 set for CaBS_Ca{1} + CaBS_Ca{1} -> NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} NT{1} 

Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 9.3073e-02 set for Ca{1} + CaBS{1} -> CaBS_Ca{1} 

Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 1.0000e-01 set for VGCC_O{1} -> Ca{1} VGCC_O{1} 
	Probability 5.0000e-04 set for VGCC_O{1} -> VGCC_C{1} 

Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 5.0000e-01 set for VGCC_C{1} -> VGCC_O{1} 
For reaction between two (or three) surface molecules the upper probability limit is given. The effective reaction probability will be recalculated dynamically during simulation.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of Ca was 5.16 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of VGCC_C was 2.06 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.
