Exiting run loop.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of VGCC_C was 0.14 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.
