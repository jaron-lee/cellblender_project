Warning: Some reactions were missed because reaction probability exceeded 1.
  CaBS_Ca[1] + CaBS_Ca[1]  --  99.99% of reactions missed.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of Ca was 3.18 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of NT was 7.4 timesteps.
  Mean lifetime of VGCC_C was 2.78 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.
